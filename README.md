Short introduction
This project uses Office of Rail and Road datasets to analyse rail reliability in Great Britain. I combine quarterly cancellations and punctuality with annual passenger journeys to describe trends, benchmark operators, estimate a fixed effects model of punctuality on cancellations, and segment operators using k means clustering. All outputs are reproducible from one R script.
