Short introduction
This project uses Office of Rail and Road datasets to analyse rail reliability in Great Britain. I combine quarterly cancellations and punctuality with annual passenger journeys to describe trends, benchmark operators, estimate a fixed effects model of punctuality on cancellations, and segment operators using k means clustering. All outputs are reproducible from one R script.
Research questions
RQ1 How did Great Britain quarterly cancellation rates change from April 2019 to September 2025
RQ2 How did Great Britain punctuality within three minutes change over the same period
RQ3 Within operators over time is a higher cancellation rate associated with lower punctuality after controlling for operator and quarter effects
RQ4 Do annual passenger journeys move alongside annual reliability when reliability is aggregated to financial years
Key findings
Reliability varies substantially across quarters and shows clear time effects
Operators differ widely in weighted cancellation rates and punctuality
Fixed effects regression shows a strong negative association between cancellation rate and punctuality
Annual journeys recover after the pandemic shock and move alongside changing reliability but the annual comparison is descriptive
